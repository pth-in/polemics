# About This Blog

This blog provides critical fact-checking and analysis of historical, scientific, and cultural claims. Each post examines evidence, methodology, and academic consensus to separate fact from fiction.

## Our Mission

In an era of information overload and misinformation, we aim to:

- **Examine claims critically** using established scientific and academic methods
- **Evaluate evidence** from multiple sources and perspectives
- **Present findings clearly** with proper citations and context
- **Respect cultural and religious traditions** while maintaining scientific rigor

## Methodology

When fact-checking claims, we consider:

1. **Peer Review**: Has the research been published in peer-reviewed journals?
2. **Academic Consensus**: What do mainstream experts in relevant fields say?
3. **Methodology**: Is the methodology sound and free from bias?
4. **Evidence Quality**: Is the evidence direct and unambiguous, or indirect and interpretable?
5. **Alternative Explanations**: Have alternative explanations been considered?
6. **Falsifiability**: Can the claims be tested and potentially disproven?

## Disclaimer

This blog is not affiliated with any academic institution, though we strive to base our analysis on mainstream academic consensus. The views expressed are those of the authors and are intended to contribute to public understanding of scientific and historical claims.
